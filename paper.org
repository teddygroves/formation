#+TITLE: Bayesian analysis of biochemical thermodynamics data 
#+AUTHOR: Teddy Groves

* Introduction

The behaviour of networks of metabolic reactions is determined, among other
factors, by the amount of energy each reaction releases or stores from its
environment; that is, the reaction's Gibbs free energy change $\Delta_rG$. In
order to make best use of metabolomic and fluxomic data about a biological
system - for example to predict whether an intervention like over-expressing an
enzyme would help or hinder an organism's metabolism - information about the
system's thermodynamics is required.

While $\Delta_rG$ has been measured for some reactions, network modelling
requires values for reactions where it has not yet been measured or for which
direct measurement would be infeasible. These reactions' properties must be
inferred from related measurements, together with biological and thermodynamic
knowledge.

This paper proposes a novel approach to the task of inferring biochemical Gibbs
free energy changes, framing it as a Bayesian statistical inference problem.

* Theoretical background

This section explains how biochemical reactions' Gibbs free energy changes are
affected by the formation energies of their reactants, as well as experimental
conditions and ion dissociation constants.

** How Gibbs energies of reaction depend on formation energies of reactants
The formation energy of a compound is the amount of energy that is stored or
released by the chemical reaction that creates it out of its constituent
elements. For example, according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Gibbs_free_energy_of_formation][Wikipedia]], liquid water has a formation
energy of -237.14 kilojoules per mole. This means that creating 1 mole of
liquid water out of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen stores 237.14 kilojoules of
energy from the surrounding environment.

The relationship between the condition-specific gibbs free energy change of a
reaction $\Delta_r G'^{o}$ and the condition-specific formation energies $s_i
\Delta_f G'^{o}$ and stoichiometric coefficients $s$ of its reactants is as
follows:

$$
\Delta_r G^{o\prime} = \sum_{i\ is\ a\ reactant} s_i \Delta_f G_i^{o\prime}
$$

Since stoichiometric coefficients are typically well-known, biochemical Gibbs
energy changes are essentially determined by the formation energies of their
reactants.

** How formation energies of compounds depend on formation energies of microspecies

When dissolved in water, most biologically interesting compounds exist in
several different forms called 'pseudoisomers' or 'microspecies', each with a
different configuration of bindings to metal and hydrogen ions (the latter is
sometimes referred to as a protonation state). The different microspecies have
different thermodynamic characteristics and relative proportions respond
differently to experimental conditions like temperature, ionic strength and
concentration of metal and hydrogen ions. Consequently the different
microspecies they need to be considered individually in order to capture the
behaviour of the whole compound.

The relationship between a compound's condition-specific formation energy and
those of its microspecies is as follows:[fn:: see
cite:albertyThermodynamicsBiochemicalReactions2003 section 4.5, 'thermodynamics
of pseudoisomer groups at specified pH']

$$
\Delta_f G^{o\prime} = -RT \ln \sum_{i\ is\ a\ microspecies} \exp(-\frac{\Delta_f G_i^{o\prime}}{RT})
$$

** How formation energies of microspecies depend on conditions
The condition-specific formation energy of a microspecies has the following
relationship with the conditions (i.e. the temperature $T$, ionic strength $I$,
$pH$ and $pMg$), the microspecies's standard-condition formation entropy
$\Delta_f S^o$, the properties of the microspecies (i.e. its charge $z$, its
number of protons $nH$ and its number of magnesium ions $nMg$) and some
temperature-specific quantities (the formation energy of magnesium $\Delta_f
G_{Mg}^{o}(T)$ and the Debeye-Hükel number $\alpha$):[fn:: see
cite:duTemperatureDependentEstimationGibbs2018 supplementary material, equation 8]

\begin{align*}
\Delta_f G^{o\prime} &= \Delta_f G^{o} \\
 &−\ (T − 298.15)\cdot \Delta_f S^o \\
 &+\ nH\cdot RT\cdot \ln(10)\cdot pH \\
 &-\ nM\cdot (\Delta_f G_{Mg}^{o}(T) - RT \cdot \ln(10)\cdot pMg) \\
 &-\ RT\cdot\alpha\cdot(z^2 - nH)\cdot(\frac{\sqrt I}{1+\sqrt I} - 0.3 \cdot I)
\end{align*}

** How formation energies of microspecies can be inferred from dissociation constants
Standard-condition formation energies of microspecies are typically not all
measured directly. Fortunately, the binding reactions that form diffent
microspecies can be measured, making it possible to infer relative formation
energies. The quantities measured are called dissociation constants. The
dissociation constant for a binding reaction is the equilibrium ratio between
the concentration of substrates to products, i.e. the unbound compound and
ligand vs the bound compound. Negative log-scale acid dissociation constants
are called $PK_a$ and negative log-scale magnesium dissociation constants are
called $PK_{Mg}$. 

If a microspecies with minimum hydrogen ions has formation energy $\Delta_f
G^o_0$, then a microspecies of the same compound with the same number of
magnesium ions and $n$ more hydrogen ions has formation energy

$$
\Delta_f G^o_n = \Delta_f G^o_0 - \sum_{i=0}^n RT\cdot\log_{10}(PK_{ai})
$$

Similarly for magnesium ions, if a microspecies with no magnesium ions has
formation energy $\Delta_f G^o_0$, then a microspecies of the same compound
with the same number of hydrogen ions and $n$ more magnesium ions has formation
energy

$$
\Delta_f G^o_n = \Delta_f G^o_0 + n\cdot\Delta_f G^o_{Mg}  - \sum_{i=0}^nRT\cdot\log_{10}(PK_{Mgi})
$$

where $\Delta_f G^{o}_{Mg}$ is the standard condition formation energy of
magnesium. This extra term appears because magnesium ions are bonded pairs of
magnesium atoms and some energy is required to form the bond, whereas hydrogen
ions have zero formation energy.

** Summary

The theoretical machinery described above makes it possible to express the
gibbs free energy change of a biochemical reactions in given conditions as a
function of the conditions, the formation energies and entropies of its
reactants and the dissociation constants of those reactants' microspecies. The
procedure is as follows:

1. Find the relative condition-independent formation energies of all
   microspecies of all reactants using dissociation constants.
2. Find the condition-specific formation energy of each microspecies using its
   condition-independent formation energy and entropy, the conditions and
   supporting information like the Debeye-Hükel numbers.
3. Find the condition-specific formation energy of each reactant using those of
   its microspecies.
4. Find the condition specific gibbs free energy change of the reaction using
   the formation energies and stoichiometric coefficients of its reactants.

* Proposed model
This paper proposes to treat the analysis of biochemical thermodynamics data as
a Bayesian statistical inference problem. This means specifying unknown
quantities, measurements, a measurement model specifying how the measurements
provide information about the unknown quantities and a prior model representing
the available pre-experimental information about the unknowns.

The unknown quantities in our model are the standard-condition compound
formation energies and dissociation constants. 

The measurements come in three categories: direct measurements of microspecies'
formation energies, dissociation constant measurements and measurements of
equilibrium constants. Another category that ought to be included is
measurements of reduction potential change due to redox reactions; the current
paper does not do this as no such reactions are involved in the available data.

The measurement model incorporates probabilistic assumptions about measurement
error - i.e. how the measurements depend on the true values of the measured
quantities - and deterministic assumptions about how the measured quantities
depend on the unknown quantities.

For the probabilistic assumptions we use a regression model where the observed
gibbs energy changes (derived from values of observed equilibrium constants),
dissociation constants and formation energies are noisy draws from a normal
distribution centered at the true values of these quantities, with the scale of
the noise known in advance.

The deterministic component of the measurement model specifies the relationship
between observed gibbs energy changes and partially latent compound formation
energies and dissociation constants, using the theoretical relationships
described above, with one deviation. Unlike in
[[cite:duTemperatureDependentEstimationGibbs2018]], we exclude the effect of
temperature and formation entropy from the calculation of microspecies'
condition-specific formation energies, and exclude ions other than Hydrogen and
Magnesium. Both of these exclusions are for the sake of simplicity and
introduce potential biases.

The prior model for standard-condition compound formation energies is a vector
of independent normal distributions with known location and scale parameters
derived from background knowledge. 

The prior model for dissociation constants needs to take into account that for
the same microspecies and ion kind (i.e. hydogen or magnesium), each successive
binding reaction has a lower dissociation constant than the last. Our prior
model enforces this constraint by representing information about the absolute
value each compound and ion type's first dissociation constant with a normal
distribution, and information about the differences between subsequent
dissociation constants with lognormal distributions.

In mathematical formulation our model is as follows:
