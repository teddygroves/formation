#+TITLE: A Bayesian regression model for analysing biochemical thermodynamics

This repository contains data and code for fitting the data from Du et al
(2019) using a structured Bayesian regression model.

* How to run the model

Working in a python 3 environment with ~make~ and a C++ toolchain available
(this is required in order to use [[https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html][cmdstanpy]]), run the following command-line
commands:

#+begin_src bash
pip install requirements.txt
install_cmdstan  # if you haven't already done this
make
#+end_src
